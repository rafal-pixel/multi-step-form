# multi-step-form

Multi-step form was created based on a challenge from https://www.frontendmentor.io. The task was done on the basis of preview graphic files and provided typography from the style-guide.md file, in mapping the layout I did not have access to sketch or figma files.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to: 

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  -- A field has been missed
  -- The email address is not formatted correctly
  -- A step is submitted, but no selection has been made
